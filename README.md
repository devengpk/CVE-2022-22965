# Spring4Shell-PoC Application

This application has been containerized and is susceptible to the Spring4Shell flaw (CVE-2022-22965). The war's complete Java source is available and changeable; it may be rebuilt each time the docker image is created. Tomcat will then start loading the created WAR. This application is a straightforward hello world that is based on [Spring tutorials](https://spring.io/guides/gs/handling-form-submission/). It has nothing exceptional to offer.
